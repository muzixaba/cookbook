# Use the following to prompt in general

## Prompt Structure
A prompt should have the following:

### A Persona/Role
Give the LLM a role to play or let it know what role you're in.
e.g. You're a sales development rep for a software company that sells cemetery software in a KZN area in South Africa

### Context
Give the LLM an idea of the situation
e.g. The company targets municipalities, private memorial parks, and churches for its software
Context can be expanded by doing the following:
- Giving an example of what you want
- Listing out important things to consider in the response
- referring to a file, url, image, or sound.

### Task
This is the only required part of the prompt.
e.g. Give me a list of potential clients located under the eThekwini municipality.

### Format
How do you want the results to be returned?
e.g. List the results a table format with the organisation's name, location, contact number, alt number, email, and contact person. Leave blank spaces where you don't have the info.
